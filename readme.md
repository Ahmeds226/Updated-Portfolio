# Updated-Portfolio

Within this new application I have updated:

1. My Github profile.
2. My LinkedIN profile.
3. My Resume.

I have also redesigned my portfolio to esnure that it has a polished, mobile-responsive user interface whilst preventing eye-strain and making it ensuring that it doesnt look like a unstyled HTML site.
